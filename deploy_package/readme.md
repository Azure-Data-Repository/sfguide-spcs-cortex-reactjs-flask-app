# Hello Snowday

This modern application running in Snowpark Container Services leverages built-in Large Language Model for handling customer call transcripts offering a comprehensive suite of functionalities to streamline and optimize customer interaction data. This application helps to automatically categorize transcripts based on sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) and identify the underlying reasons or themes (e.g., product defects, shipping issues, or praise for service). 

Through Natural Language Processing (NLP), it is able to extract actionable insights, pinpoint areas for improvement, and identify frequently raised customer concerns. It also provides real-time feedback to customer service representatives, suggesting responses or solutions based on past interactions. 

Moreover, the continuous learning capability of built-in LLMs means that the application becomes increasingly accurate and insightful over time, adapting to changing customer feedback and trends.
